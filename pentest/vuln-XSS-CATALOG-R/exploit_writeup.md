# Vulnerability Report: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SQL Injection

## 1. Executive Summary
**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SQL Injection
**Severity:** Critical
**Affected Endpoint:** `/api/v1/courses`
**Parameter:** `filter`

The application contains a critical vulnerability where the `filter` parameter is susceptible to SQL Injection. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the database query to return arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code. Because the frontend application renders this database output unsafely (using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), the injected script executes immediately in the victim's browser.

This is a "Chained Vulnerability": **SQL Injection** is used as the delivery mechanism for **Reflected XSS**.

## 2. Technical Details

### Vulnerable Code Analysis
**Backend (`backend/routers/courses.py`):**
The application constructs a SQL query using an f-string without parameterization or sanitization.
```python
# VULNERABLE: Input is directly concatenated into the SQL string
query = f"SELECT * FROM courses WHERE title LIKE '%{filter}%'"
