# Vulnerability: SQL Injection in Course Search

## Description
The `/api/v1/courses` endpoint accepts a `filter` query parameter that is directly interpolated into the SQL query string using f-strings. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query structure.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Send a GET request to `/api/v1/courses?filter=' UNION SELECT 1, email, password_hash, 4, 5 FROM users --`.
2. Observe that the response contains user credentials instead of course data.

## Impact
Critical. Allows full database dump, including admin credentials.

## Remediation
Use SQLAlchemy ORM filters or parameterized queries instead of raw SQL strings.
