# Vulnerability: Weak Password Storage (MD5)

## Description
The application stores user passwords in the `university.db` database using the **MD5** hashing algorithm. MD5 is cryptographically broken and considered unsafe for password storage because it is fast to compute, making it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. Additionally, the hashes are not salted.

## Prerequisites
* Access to the database file (`university.db`) OR
* Ability to perform SQL Injection to dump the `users` table.

## Steps to Reproduce
1.  Navigate to the `pentest/vuln-WEAK-PW/` directory.
2.  Ensure the `university.db` file exists in the backend folder.
3.  Run the proof-of-concept script:
    ```bash
    python poc.py
    ```
4.  The script connects to the database, extracts the admin's password hash (`5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`), and compares it against a dictionary of common passwords.
5.  **Result:** The script successfully cracks the hash and outputs the plaintext password: `admin123`.

## Evidence
* **Hash Extracted:** `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`
* **Cracked Password:** `admin123`
* See `screenshots/poc_output.png` for terminal execution proof.

## Impact
**Severity: High**
If the database is compromised (e.g., via SQL Injection), attackers can easily reverse the hashes to obtain plaintext passwords. This leads to:
* **Account Takeover:** Attackers can log in as administrators.
* **Credential Stuffing:** If users reuse passwords, their accounts on other services are also at risk.

## CVSS (Approximate)
* **Base Score:** 7.5 (High)
* **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (Assuming DB dump via SQLi)

## Remediation
1.  **Upgrade Hashing Algorithm:** Replace MD5 with a modern, slow hashing algorithm such as **BCrypt**, **Argon2**, or **PBKDF2**.
2.  **Implement Salting:** Ensure every password is hashed with a unique, random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks.
3.  **Migration Strategy:** On the next successful login, re-hash the user's password using the new algorithm transparently.
