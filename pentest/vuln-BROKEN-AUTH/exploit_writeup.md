# Vulnerability Report: Hardcoded Administrative Backdoor

**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.8)
**Type:** Broken Authentication / Backdoor
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/admin/courses` (and potentially others)

## Description
A hardcoded credential vulnerability was discovered in the application's authentication logic. The backend code contains a "backdoor" check that allows any request containing the HTTP header `X-Admin-Access: SuperSecretAdmin123` to bypass all standard authentication (JWT/Login).

This allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute administrative actions—such as creating courses, deleting users, or modifying grades—simply by adding this specific header to their request.

## Impact
* **Full System Compromise:** Attackers act as Super Admins without a password.
* **Data Integrity Loss:** Attackers can inject fake courses (as demonstrated) or alter records.
* **Access Control Bypass:** Completely circumvents role-based access control (RBAC).

## Reproduction Steps (PoC)
1.  Target the `POST /api/v1/admin/courses` endpoint.
2.  Append the header `X-Admin-Access: SuperSecretAdmin123`.
3.  Send a JSON payload to create a new course.
4.  **Result:** The server accepts the request and creates the course, even if no user is logged in.

## Remediation
**Patch:** Remove the conditional block in the dependency injector that checks for `X-Admin-Access`. Ensure all administrative endpoints strictly require a valid JWT token signed by the server.

**Code to Remove:**
```python
# REMOVE THIS BLOCK
if request.headers.get("X-Admin-Access") == "SuperSecretAdmin123":
    return User(id=1, role="admin", ...)
